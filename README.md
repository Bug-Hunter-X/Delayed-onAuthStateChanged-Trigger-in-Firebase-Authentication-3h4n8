# Delayed Firebase onAuthStateChanged Trigger

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: delayed triggering after authentication events.  The issue can lead to unexpected application behavior if not addressed properly.

## Problem

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not immediately reflect authentication state changes (login, logout). This is particularly problematic when your application needs to react instantly to these changes, and is using asynchronous operations.

## Solution

The provided solution illustrates several ways to handle this issue, demonstrating how to manage asynchronous actions and ensure reliable authentication state updates, potentially utilizing promises or a loading state indicator.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start` (This assumes you have the necessary Firebase configuration set up.)
4. Observe the delays in authentication state updates and how the solution improves this.
